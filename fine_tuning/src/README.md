# Fine-Tuning Scripts

This directory contains scripts for preparing and running Flux LoRA fine-tuning on Replicate.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. create_training_zip.py

Creates a training data zip file that follows Replicate's requirements for Flux fine-tuning:

- Takes images from `../data/ballerina/`
- Uses captions from `../data/template_ballerina.json`
- Creates a zip file containing both images and their corresponding caption text files
- Each image's caption is saved in a .txt file with the same name (e.g., 001.png â†’ 001.txt)
- Output: `../data/training_data.zip`

### 2. train_flux_lora.py

Handles the Flux LoRA training process on Replicate:

- Uses the Replicate API to initiate and monitor training
- Configures optimal training parameters
- Supports integration with Weights & Biases for monitoring
- Can automatically upload the trained model to HuggingFace

## Configuration

### config.json

A configuration file (gitignored) that stores API tokens:

```json
{
  "replicate_api_token": "your-replicate-token-here",
  "huggingface_token": "your-huggingface-token-here",
  "wandb_api_key": "your-wandb-key-here"
}
```

## Training Parameters

The training script uses the following optimized parameters:

- Trigger word: "BALLERINA"
- Steps: 1000
- LoRA rank: 16
- Learning rate: 0.0004
- Batch size: 1
- Resolution: "512,768,1024"
- Autocaption: Disabled (using our own captions)
- Caption dropout rate: 0.05
- Optimizer: adamw8bit

## Usage

1. First, prepare the training data:

```bash
python create_training_zip.py
```

2. Update config.json with your API tokens

3. Run the training:

```bash
python train_flux_lora.py
```

The training script will:

- Upload the training data
- Start the training process
- Provide a URL to monitor progress
- Wait for completion and show results
- Save the model to HuggingFace (if configured)

## Using the Trained Model

Once training is complete, you can use the trained model in your prompts by including the trigger word "BALLERINA". This will activate the learned style in your generations.

Example prompt:

```
A BALLERINA dancing in a garden
```

## Requirements

Required packages are listed in the root requirements.txt:

- replicate
- python-dotenv
- Pillow
- numpy
- tqdm
