Her large, almond-shaped eyes sit close together with heavily lined dark eyeliner. The forehead flows smoothly into the nose without wrinkles, following the Disney-like construction of an egg-shaped skull with jaw attached as a secondary structure. Minimal upper eyelid visibility exists between thin, arched eyebrows and eyes. Cheekbones extend in straight lines to the narrow jawline, with space between eye corners and cheekbone lines. Full lips are prominently puckered outward. Long black hair frames the face, which narrows to an exaggerated point at the chin. The skin tone is pale pink with subtle blush, contrasting against a golden background. The neck is unnaturally thin and long."

Her head has an egg-like shape where the top is wider than the bottom, with prominent forward-projecting cheekbones and forehead creating depth.

      "caption": "The cartoon caricature depicts a man with an extraordinarily elongated, rectangular face that stretches dramatically downward to a squared-off chin. His messy black hair is styled wildly, with volume on top and longer strands framing the sides of his face, accentuating the extreme vertical elongation. His eyebrows are enormous, thick black crescents that dominate the upper portion of his face, almost appearing as separate entities from his facial structure. His eyes are completely closed, represented by simple curved lines, giving him a serene or smug expression. His nose is remarkably long and straight, extending downward for an impossible length before ending in a small, rounded tip. His mouth forms a subtle, self-satisfied smile that creates minimal lines across his extraordinarily narrow face. High, angular cheekbones create subtle shadows on his otherwise smooth complexion. His neck appears almost non-existent as his elongated face seems to flow directly into his shoulders. He holds a lit cigarette between the slender fingers of his right hand, with a wispy trail of smoke curling upward along the side of his face. He wears a formal black jacket over a crisp white shirt with what appears to be a black tie or bow tie. The entire caricature is set against a gradient dark blue background that highlights the extreme vertical exaggeration of his features. The overall impression emphasizes the dramatic rectangular elongation of his face, creating an almost architectural quality to his appearance."

His eyes are half-lidded with large white areas, looking slightly to the side with a knowing or judgmental expression. His nose is large and broad, with pronounced flaring nostrils. Deep nasolabial folds run from his nose to the corners of his mouth, which is pulled into an asymmetrical smirk with the left side higher than the right.

Long, curled eyelashes frame her eyes, which are topped by perfectly arched, thin eyebrows. Her nose is small and distinctly upturned at the tip. Her cheekbones are dramatically rounded and project outward, creating pronounced blush areas on her face. Her lips are extremely full and painted bright red, with the mouth slightly open showing a glimpse of upper teeth. The entire lower portion of her face curves outward and forward, following the directional thrust established by her upturned nose. Her neck is unnaturally long and thin, creating an elegant, swan-like appearance that leads to gently sloping shoulders.

      "caption": "The cartoon caricature depicts a woman with an extremely wide, heart-shaped face that's significantly broader than it is tall. Her long, luxurious blonde hair is parted in the center and flows down in thick, wavy strands that frame her face and cascade past her shoulders. Her most striking feature is her unnaturally large, round blue eyes with exaggerated white sclera that bulge outward and are set unusually far apart on her face. This eye placement creates a distinctive effect where the cheekbones appear almost pinched or compressed by the protruding eyeballs. The skin above her eyes, between the eyebrows and eyelids, appears stretched and taut due to the bulging eyes. Her eyebrows are thin, highly arched, and dark brown, contrasting with her blonde hair. Her nose is minimal and button-like, barely protruding from her otherwise flat face. Her lips are full and painted bright coral-red, pulled into a wide smile that reveals her upper teeth. Her chin is small and pointed, completing the heart-shaped face structure. Her neck is exceptionally long and slender, leading to barely visible shoulders. She appears to be wearing a red sleeveless top with a low neckline. The entire caricature is set against a gradient teal background that highlights her blonde hair and the extreme width of her face.

Her eyebrows are thin, highly arched, and positioned high on her forehead. Her nose is small and slightly upturned. Her cheeks are full and rounded with pronounced blush, pushed upward by her extremely wide smile that reveals perfectly aligned white upper teeth. Her mouth is disproportionately wide for her face, emphasizing her enthusiastic expression. She has a slender neck that leads to narrow shoulders covered by a short-sleeved reddish-coral blouse with a visible collar. In her right hand, she holds a silver-gray microphone near her face, while her left hand extends outward with fingers elegantly splayed in an expressive gesture.
