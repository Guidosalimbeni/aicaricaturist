#### **Rules for Effective Caricature Descriptions**

1. **Always identify the most exaggerated feature first** - Begin with the most dramatically altered aspect of the face.
2. **Use contrasting pairs of descriptors** - Combine terms like "extraordinarily wide yet impossibly thin" to highlight disproportion.
3. **Reference geometric shapes** - Use shapes (e.g., triangular, oval) to visualize stylization.
4. **Note directionality** - Specify projection, recession, or angles (e.g., "projecting forward dramatically").
5. **Describe relational positioning** - Explain feature relationships (e.g., "eyes set so far apart they nearly reach the edges").
6. **Use extreme modifiers liberally** - Apply terms like "impossibly," "extraordinarily," "dramatically" to emphasize exaggeration.
7. **Reference the emotional effect** - Note how exaggerations reflect personality or emotion.
8. **Compare proportions** - Highlight disproportionate relationships (e.g., "tiny nose overwhelmed by massive eyes").
9. **Note textural contrasts** - Describe differences (e.g., smooth forehead vs. wrinkled cheeks).
10. **Acknowledge the stylistic intent** - Reference the cartoon style and its purpose.
11. **Be specific about colors** - Use precise terms (e.g., "jet-black" instead of "dark").
