## Framework for Structured Caricature Descriptions

### 1. Head Structure Description

Start with the overall shape and proportion of the head. Mention any dramatic elongation, compression, or distinctive silhouette.

Example: "The cartoon caricature depicts a man with an extremely elongated, rectangular face that stretches dramatically downward to a squared-off chin."

### 2. Hair Description

Detail the hairstyle, volume, color, and any distinctive styling elements. Note how the hair frames or influences the perceived shape of the face.

Example: "His voluminous, copper-colored hair is styled into an enormous pompadour that adds significant height to his silhouette, with perfectly coiffed waves that seem to defy gravity."

### 3. Forehead and Brow Description

Describe the size, shape, and any distinctive features of the forehead. Include details about eyebrows and any visible wrinkles or expressions lines.

Example: "His forehead is dramatically tall and sloped backward, marked by three distinct horizontal wrinkle lines. His eyebrows are extraordinarily thick and arched high above his eyes in a perpetually surprised expression."

### 4. Eye Description

Detail the shape, size, positioning, and any distinctive features of the eyes. Include details about makeup, eyelids, and direction of gaze.

Example: "His eyes are unnaturally small and close-set, with hooded lids that create a perpetually suspicious look. The bright blue irises are directed slightly upward and to the side, enhanced by subtle crow's feet at the corners."

### 5. Nose Description

Describe the size, shape, and any distinctive features of the nose. Note its projection from the face and any unusual characteristics.

Example: "His nose is remarkably long and hooked, extending dramatically from his face before curving downward at the tip. The nostrils are flared and prominently defined."

### 6. Mouth and Chin Description

Detail the shape, size, and expression of the mouth. Include information about lips, visible teeth, and the shape and prominence of the chin.

Example: "Her lips are extraordinarily full and painted bright red, pulled into an asymmetrical smirk that reveals just a glimpse of upper teeth. Her chin is small but sharply pointed, jutting forward slightly."

### 7. Cheek and Jaw Description

Describe the contours of the cheeks and the shape and definition of the jawline.

Example: "His cheekbones are impossibly high and pronounced, creating hollow pockets below them that dramatically shadow the face. The jawline is strongly angular, with a distinctive square shape that emphasizes the masculine features."

### 8. Ear Description

If visible, detail the size, shape, and positioning of the ears. Include any accessories.

Example: "His ears are disproportionately large and set at an angle that makes them protrude noticeably from the sides of his head."

### 9. Neck Description

Describe the length, thickness, and any distinctive features of the neck. Note how it connects to the shoulders if visible.

Example: "Her neck is unnaturally long and impossibly slender, creating a swan-like elegance that enhances her regal bearing."

### 10. Clothing and Accessories Description

Detail any visible clothing items, jewelry, glasses, or other accessories that contribute to the character of the caricature.

Example: "He wears a formal black tuxedo jacket with exaggerated wide lapels over a crisp white shirt and oversized black bow tie. A bright red pocket square adds a pop of color."

### 11. Expression and Character Description

Summarize the overall emotional expression and character conveyed by the caricature.

Example: "The overall impression emphasizes his sly, calculating demeanor through the combination of his narrowed eyes, raised single eyebrow, and knowing smirk."

### 12. Background and Composition Notes

Include details about the background color or setting and how it enhances the caricature.

Example: "The entire caricature is set against a gradient blue background that highlights his pale coloring and the stark white of his hair."

## Rules for Effective Caricature Descriptions

1. **Always identify the most exaggerated feature first** - Begin with whatever aspect of the face has been most dramatically altered from normal proportions.

2. **Use contrasting pairs of descriptors** - Employ terms like "extraordinarily wide yet impossibly thin" to emphasize the deliberate disproportion of caricature.

3. **Reference geometric shapes** - Describe features in terms of recognizable shapes (triangular, oval, rectangular) to help visualize the stylization.

4. **Note directionality** - Specify whether features project forward, recede, angle upward/downward, or extend horizontally/vertically.

5. **Describe relational positioning** - Explain how features relate to each other (e.g., "eyes set so far apart they nearly reach the edges of the face").

6. **Use extreme modifiers liberally** - Employ terms like "impossibly," "extraordinarily," "dramatically," and "remarkably" to emphasize the exaggeration.

7. **Reference the emotional effect** - Note how the exaggeration creates an impression of personality traits or emotions.

8. **Compare proportions** - Describe how certain features are disproportionate to others (e.g., "tiny eyes overwhelmed by the massive nose").

9. **Note textural contrasts** - Describe differences in how smooth, wrinkled, taut, or loose different facial areas appear.

10. **Acknowledge the stylistic intent** - Reference the overall cartoon style and what it emphasizes about the subject.

11. **Be specific about colors** - Use precise color terminology rather than generic terms.

12. **Describe the silhouette** - Note how the outline of the head and hair creates a distinctive shape.

By applying this vocabulary and framework systematically, you can create comprehensive, consistent descriptions of facial caricatures that capture the essential exaggerated elements that define the style.
