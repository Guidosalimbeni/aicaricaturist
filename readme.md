A repository for training a stable diffusion model specifically for caricature
I need a folder for training the model and folder for the actual app
the app for now is simply a user interface where the user can upload a front and side picture
in a nice bootstrap css style and with a short description as an app for caricature service online
the main focus for now is about the training folder as I need to develop the diffusion model that would create the caricature
i want to use a control net because my idea is to get the picture from the user
draw an outiline of the feature by hand using a digital pen
this outilne will be the constrain to create the caricature
so a sketch to caricature
the training data is a collection of caricature of mine for which I have a picture of the original person
i am going to trace the outline of the face by hand and this will be the element to train the model.
